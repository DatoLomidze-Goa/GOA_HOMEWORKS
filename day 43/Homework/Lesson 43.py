#1: Code as fast as you can! You need to double the integer and return it.

#პირველი ლინკი არ იხსნება 


#2:Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0. Your function only needs to return the result, what is shown between parentheses in the example below is how you reach that result and it's not part of it, see the sample tests.
#For example (Input -> Output):

#def summation(num):
    #return sum(range(1,num+1))


#3:Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

#Style Points
#Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?


#def greet():
    #return "hello world!"


#4:Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

#For example,

#[True,  True,  True,  False,
#  True,  True,  True,  True , 
#  True,  False, True,  False,
#  True,  False, False, True ,
#  True,  True,  True,  True ,
#  False, False, True,  True]


#def count_sheeps(arrayOfSheeps):
  #return arrayOfSheeps.count(True)


#5:Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

#'world'  =>  'dlrow'
#'word'   =>  'drow'


#def solution(str):
    #return str[::-1]
