    <p>Murdergram Deux ft. Eminem - LL COOL J

        ...
        
        Do you remember first time you heard the legend in leather?
        
        The career ender with the road-killer stuck to his fender
        
        I'm on another bender, drunk off the power
        
        That make a coward surrender as I devour contenders
        
        Talkin' foul of whoever, your head is 'bout to get severed
        
        Then I bounce it with pleasure, I'm pouring out Amaretto
        
        Homies, I won't forgеt 'em, so tap the bottle and pour it
        
        Supermodels I ignore 'em, later on it's like porn
        
        Reincarnation of the Ripper, I give stitches and chest zippers
        
        Cinderella's get propellered out their glass slippers
        
        Time is tickin', giving ass whoppin's how we keep the cash flippin'

        Ayra Starr 'Commas' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified
        
        What? A supa-dupa switch up (What?)
        
        I can't understand a single word you're saying
        
        I think you have syrup brain
        
        'Bout to finish you like polyurethane (Huh)
        
        All that molly probably sure to drain your spinal fluid from your vertebrae
        
        This the Murdergram and I brought my murder game
        
        My shit fire, that is why you log on it like Duraflame
        
        But as far as boulevards, I'm talking 'bout Farmers like insurance claims (Pff)
        
        I just blew your girl away, but she on so much blow and lean (What?)
        
        
        I call that fucking ho Katrina, somebody better give her a cane
        
        And that's on everything (What?), she love my heavy chain
        
        My yellow diamond shining, got her whipping like lemon meringue
        
        Stripping in front of the gang, she's slipping inside of the Range
        
        Quick to go out with a bang, it's like I threw out a grenade
        
        Once you pull the pin, that's when the killing will begin
        
        You feel me pulling off your skin, I really came to get it and deliver
        
        Murdergrams, turn over your ambulance, thirty bullets in advance
        
        Candlelight and crying fans, we gon' win it by a land-slide up behind you, testing my rifle
        
        Give blessings to my disciples, professional I'm a sniper
        
        Like eight miles away, me and Marshall doing murders
        
        With dirty burners, break them down and melt them in the furnace
        
        Unapologetic and we're gonna cause a headache
        
        Me and L about to set it, we about to murdergram it
        
        Anyone of y'all can get it, so you might as well forget it
        
        Either way you will regret it, cemetery’s where you're headed
        
        Come on! (Yeah)
        
        The message in the chorus, you bastards got nothing for us
        
        The overlord is the rawest
        
        I ain't talkin' 'bout a rental car when I'm pullin' the Taurus
        
        This Halloween them candy bars'll get you killed in the forest
        
        We are lyrically lawless, stackin' money, hoarders
        
        Slugs that make you forget all that slick-ass shit that you thought of
        
        Blow your mind with the sawed off
        
        Just when you thought it was safe, we bustin' at you from the Wraith
        
        Then hittin' a donut, ain’t nothin' sweet when we come in to play
        
        When I say that you ain't fuckin' with moi
        
        I do not mean kisses blew, but I got the potential to
        
        Fuckin' flip when I'm mentioned with a penchant to (What?)
        
        Come back with a vengeance like Jack the Ripper
        
        To rip it, just givin' you a sample, a fuckin' snippet (Snip it), like scissors do
        
        Now when I hit the booth, I think of the days of old when I was quick to fool
        
        Used to fly off the handle like a fuckin' witch's broom
        
        I called it pluckin' flowers 'cause I was so quick to pick a tool up (Click-click)
        
        Like it's petunias, sick medulla, but thanks to COOL J, he created a monster (What? Yeah!)
        
        Spaghetti sauce and mozzarella on a tray full of pasta (What?)
        
        You got a couple of motherfuckin' trained killers on ya (Trained kill-lasagna's)
        
        And I'm just bein' as frank as Sinatra (Haha)
        
        When I be sayin' that I'ma keep this shit gangster as mobsters (What?)
        
        But when you got fanatics goin' so crazy, they mob ya
        
        Lookin' like organized crime because you can't get 'em off ya (Mafia)
        
        And all your motherfuckin' enemies, they wanna off ya, like Hoffa
        
        And dump your body in Lake Minnetonka (Shhh)
        
        That's how you know you fuckin' saw, and you came, and you conquered
        
        Veni, vidi, vici, stompin' and makin' 'em bonkers
        
        Now women treat me like B.D.K. (Kane), the king, and they feed me grapes (Yeah)
        
        Either way, I got more on my plate than an all you can eat buffet (Woo)
        
        So better pick a B.C. date 'cause your history is shady (Yeah, set)
        
        As they 'bout to set it on you like a TV tray (Haha, yup)
        
        Man, I see the way people say I'm so evil (What?)
        
        They fuckin' think that Timothy McVeigh and my DNA are exactly the same
        
        But when I leave this game (Nope)
        
        Things just ain't gonna be the same (Nah)
        
        But it's in need of change (Yeah), and I'm the meter maid (Haha)
        
        Go ahead and crack a bottle, 'cause this is E and J
        
        Meaning me and James (Yeah)
        
        Got that avocado and we the sociopaths
        
        And we got your ho on our laps
        
        And we're goin' back to Cali so she can blow on our sax
        
        Brang-brang, brr-brr-brr-brrr, brr-brring
        
        I don't think so</p>
